# The Startup Guide To Notification Systems

## Introduction

Startup engineering is all about weighing the return on investment that various efforts will yield in order to decide where to spend your precious development resources. Depending on the stage of your startup, your goal may be finding product market fit, solidifying product market fit, or expanding and scaling product market fit. Whatever stage you’re at, you will have at least a couple of use cases in which your software needs to communicate with your users. It may be tempting to write off this computer-to-human communication as a trivial notification, but it’s important to recognize that this is a core part of your user experience and likely a key point of user engagement for your application.
